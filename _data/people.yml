  - name: Amy Lee
    position: Assistant Professor and PI
    about: Dr. Amy Lee received her Ph.D. in Cell and Systems Biology from University of Toronto, and was a postdoctoral fellow at University of British Columbia. Her research focuses on understanding the dynamic interactions between host and pathogens, using both experimental and bioinformatic approaches. Her work ranges from understanding the molecular virulence and antimicrobial resistance mechanisms in pathogens, to looking at host immune responses during development or infection such as sepsis or COVID-19. In her spare time, she likes to work on food fermentation experiments such as culturing sourdough and making kimchi.
