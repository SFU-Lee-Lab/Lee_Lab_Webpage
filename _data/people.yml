  - name: Amy Lee
    position: Assistant Professor and PI
    about: Dr. Amy Lee received her Ph.D. in Cell and Systems Biology from University of Toronto, and was a postdoctoral fellow at University of British Columbia. Her research focuses on understanding the dynamic interactions between host and pathogens, using both experimental and bioinformatic approaches. Her work ranges from understanding the molecular virulence and antimicrobial resistance mechanisms in pathogens, to looking at host immune responses during development or infection such as sepsis or COVID-19. In her spare time, she likes to work on food fermentation experiments such as culturing sourdough and making kimchi.

  - name: Erica Acton
    position: Bioinformatician
    about: Erica is a bioinformatician who eats â€˜omics data for breakfast. She is currently using machine learning techniques to find molecular signatures for neonatal sepsis, as well as for disease severity in Covid patients. In her spare time she likes to hike preposterous distances, preferably on difficult terrain.

  - name: Patrick K. Taylor (he/him)
    position: Postdoc
    about: Pat is a postdoc in the lab primarily at the bench using his skill sets in bacterial genetics and microbiological techniques to study mechanisms of virulence and antibiotic resistance. Outside of the lab on his own time he continues to ponder about microbes even as he is working his garden, poking around tidal pools, painting, or brewing his beer.
